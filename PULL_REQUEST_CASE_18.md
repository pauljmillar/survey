# Pull Request - Case Implementation

## Case Information
- **Case Number:** Case 18
- **Case Title:** Database Schema Implementation
- **Related Use Case:** Infrastructure
- **Status:** Ready for Review

## Implementation Summary
Implemented the complete database schema for the Panelist Rewards Platform as specified in the TDD. This includes all 8 core tables with proper relationships, Row Level Security policies for the three-role architecture, and business logic functions for safe points management and activity logging.

## Key Changes
- [x] Complete PostgreSQL schema with 8 tables (users, panelist_profiles, surveys, survey_qualifications, survey_completions, merchant_offers, redemptions, activity_log)
- [x] Row Level Security policies for role-based data access
- [x] Business logic functions for points management and activity logging
- [x] Supabase integration with migrations and configuration
- [x] TypeScript type definitions for type-safe database operations
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and development setup

## Files Added/Modified
- `database/schema.sql` - Complete schema definition with tables, indexes, functions
- `database/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000001_initial_schema.sql` - Supabase migration file
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase local development configuration
- `supabase/seed.sql` - Development seed data with sample users and surveys
- `types/database.types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for all tables
- `package.json` - Added Supabase, Clerk, TanStack Query dependencies
- `env.example` - Environment variables template
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template for future cases
- `cases.yaml` - Updated Case 18 status to "R"
- `log.md` - Added completion entries

## Testing Notes
- Schema includes comprehensive RLS policies for data isolation
- Business functions include validation for negative balance prevention
- Seed data provides realistic test scenarios for all three user roles
- All foreign key constraints and check constraints properly implemented

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Updated `cases.yaml` status to "R"
- [x] Updated `log.md` with completion entry
- [x] Added comprehensive database documentation
- [x] Created environment configuration template
- [x] Added TypeScript types for all database entities

## Dependencies
- Requires Supabase account for production deployment
- Requires Clerk account for authentication integration
- No dependencies on other cases (this is foundational infrastructure)

## Screenshots/Demo
Schema supports:
- Three user roles: panelist, survey_admin, system_admin
- Points earning through survey completion
- Points redemption for merchant offers
- Complete activity audit trail
- Role-based data access controls

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows project standards
- [x] All database constraints and indexes implemented
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [x] No breaking changes (this is new infrastructure)
- [x] Ready for QA testing
- [x] Includes migration strategy for future changes
- [x] TypeScript integration complete
