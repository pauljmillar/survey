# Pull Request - Case Implementation

## Case Information
- **Case Number:** Case 20
- **Case Title:** API Routes and Services
- **Related Use Case:** Infrastructure
- **Status:** Ready for Review

## Implementation Summary
Implemented a comprehensive API infrastructure for the Panelist Rewards Platform with 8 complete endpoint groups. The API provides secure, role-based access to all platform functionality with comprehensive error handling, validation, rate limiting, and transaction safety. This completes the core infrastructure foundation needed for all frontend development.

## Key Changes
- [x] Complete API infrastructure with 8 endpoint groups covering all platform functionality
- [x] Survey management APIs with CRUD operations, availability checking, and completion workflow
- [x] Points management with real-time balance retrieval and transaction integration
- [x] Redemption processing with balance validation and transaction safety
- [x] Merchant offers management with public access and admin controls
- [x] Survey qualification management with single and bulk operations
- [x] Activity logging with privacy protection and role-based access
- [x] Rate limiting system with configurable limits per endpoint type
- [x] Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- [x] Standardized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Security headers and CORS configuration
- [x] Transaction safety for all multi-step operations

## Testing Notes
- All endpoints tested with proper authentication and authorization flows
- Input validation tested with various invalid inputs and edge cases
- Rate limiting functionality validated across different endpoint types
- Transaction safety tested with rollback scenarios for points operations
- Error handling tested with comprehensive status code validation
- Role-based permissions tested across all three user roles
- Database integration tested with all 8 tables from Case 18 schema
- Security headers and CORS configuration validated

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Comprehensive API documentation with endpoint descriptions and examples
- [x] Rate limiting configuration and security features documented
- [x] Request/response examples for all major operations
- [x] Development guidelines for adding new endpoints
- [x] Security features and best practices documentation
- [x] Updated `cases.yaml` with completion status and detailed comments
- [x] Updated `log.md` with completion entry and timestamp
- [x] Created detailed implementation summary with technical specifications

## Dependencies
- **Integrates with Case 18**: Uses all 8 database tables and RLS policies from schema
- **Integrates with Case 19**: Full authentication system integration with permission matrix
- **Enables Cases 1-8**: Complete API layer ready for panelist MVP frontend features
- **Enables Cases 9-17**: API endpoints ready for survey admin and system admin interfaces
- **Foundation for Frontend**: RESTful API design ready for React component integration

## Screenshots/Demo
**API Infrastructure Features:**
- 8 complete endpoint groups with full CRUD operations
- Role-based access control with permission matrix validation
- Rate limiting: 100 general/15min, 20 auth/15min, 5 survey completion/min, 3 redemption/min
- Transaction safety for points operations with automatic rollback on failures
- Comprehensive error handling with standardized responses
- Security headers: CORS, XSS protection, content security policies
- Real-time points balance updates without polling
- Activity logging for complete audit trail

**Key API Flows:**
- Survey completion: Validates qualification → Awards points → Updates balance → Logs activity
- Points redemption: Validates balance → Creates redemption → Deducts points → Updates totals
- Qualification management: Bulk operations for efficient survey setup
- Activity tracking: Privacy-protected logging with role-based access
