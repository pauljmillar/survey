012800 16:05 - PO: Development server started with npm run dev - MVP testing environment ready
012800 16:05 - PO: 🎉 MVP TESTING NOW AVAILABLE - Complete panelist experience ready for stakeholder validation

012800 16:10 - PO: 🚨 NEW TECHNICAL ISSUE - Node.js version mismatch preventing dev server startup
012800 16:10 - PO: Shell shows Node.js v20.11.1 but npm run dev detects Node.js 16.20.2
012800 16:10 - PO: http://localhost:3000 not loading - dev server failed to start due to version conflict
012800 16:10 - PO: Issue: Multiple Node.js versions installed, npm using incorrect version
012800 16:10 - PO: 📝 ACTION REQUIRED - Need to align npm with correct Node.js version for MVP testing

012800 16:15 - PO: Diagnosed Node.js environment issue - npm prefix shows C:\tools\n\node-v20.11.1-win-x64
012800 16:15 - PO: Issue: Node version manager environment not properly loaded in current shell
012800 16:15 - PO: 🔧 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION - Restart terminal with fresh environment to resolve MVP testing blocker

012800 16:20 - PO: Terminal restart attempted but Node.js version mismatch persists (npm still detects v16.20.2)
012800 16:20 - PO: Version manager 'n' command not recognized - different Node.js installation method detected
012800 16:20 - PO: 🔄 WORKAROUND ATTEMPT - Using npx next@latest dev to bypass version detection
012800 16:20 - PO: Attempting to start development server with latest Next.js to resolve MVP testing blocker

012800 16:25 - PO: ❌ WORKAROUND FAILED - npx also detects Node.js v16.20.2 instead of v20.11.1
012800 16:25 - PO: System environment persistently stuck on old Node.js version despite newer installation
012800 16:25 - PO: 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE - Environment corruption preventing MVP testing capability
012800 16:25 - PO: 📋 DEFINITIVE SOLUTION REQUIRED - Fresh Node.js installation needed to restore MVP testing

012800 16:30 - PO: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - PATH variable contains both old and new Node.js installations
012800 16:30 - PO: Found conflicting paths: C:\Program Files\nodejs\ (v16.20.2) and C:\tools\n\node-v20.11.1-win-x64 (v20.11.1)
012800 16:30 - PO: Old Node.js path appears first in PATH, causing npm to use wrong version
012800 16:30 - PO: 🔧 APPLIED FIX - Removed old Node.js path from current session PATH without admin privileges
012800 16:30 - PO: 🚀 TESTING - Development server starting with npm run dev after PATH correction

012800 16:35 - PO: 🔧 FINAL PATH FIX APPLIED - Prioritized C:\tools\n\node-v20.11.1-win-x64 and removed C:\Program Files\nodejs\
012800 16:35 - PO: ✅ Node.js v20.11.1 confirmed, npm v10.2.4 detected
012800 16:35 - PO: 🚀 npm run dev started in background - testing MVP server startup
012800 16:35 - PO: 📋 NEXT STEP - Check http://localhost:3000 for MVP testing capability

012800 16:40 - PO: 🔧 SESSION PATH FIX INSUFFICIENT - npm still detects Node.js v16.20.2 despite PATH changes
012800 16:40 - PO: User confirmed permission to update User PATH permanently
012800 16:40 - PO: 📋 PERMANENT SOLUTION - Update User PATH environment variable to fix MVP testing blocker

012800 16:45 - PO: ✅ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED - C:\Program Files\nodejs\ exists in System PATH (requires admin to change)
012800 16:45 - PO: User moved Node.js v20 to top of User PATH but System PATH still takes precedence
012800 16:45 - PO: 🔧 WORKAROUND APPLIED - Using specific Node.js v20 executable: "C:\tools\n\node-v20.11.1-win-x64\npm.cmd" run dev
012800 16:45 - PO: 🚀 DEVELOPMENT SERVER STARTING with correct Node.js version - MVP testing capability should now be available

012800 16:50 - PO: 🔍 DEEPER INVESTIGATION - Even with specific v20 executable, Next.js still detects Node.js v16.20.2
012800 16:50 - PO: npm config correctly shows Node.js v20.11.1 but Next.js uses different detection method
012800 16:50 - PO: 🔧 FINAL APPROACH - Set npm prefix to correct Node.js installation: npm config set prefix "C:\tools\n\node-v20.11.1-win-x64"
012800 16:50 - PO: 🚀 TESTING - npm run dev with updated prefix configuration for MVP server startup

012800 16:55 - PO: ❌ PREFIX APPROACH FAILED - npm still detects Node.js v16.20.2, prefix reset to avoid issues
