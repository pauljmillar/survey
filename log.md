072825 16:03 - PO > SR: Please review the BRD and begin initial TDD  
072825 16:10 - SR: TDD initialized, architecture defined for MVP  
072825 16:12 - SR: Created Case 14 and 15, status set to N  
072825 16:15 - SR > QA: UC03 will require error handling tests for over-redemption  
072825 16:16 - ENG: Working on Case 14, status set to I  
072825 21:44 - QA: Starting QA session - reviewing all documentation and case status
072825 21:44 - QA: Reviewed BRD (17 use cases), TDD (comprehensive architecture), and cases.yaml (23 implementation cases)
072825 21:44 - QA: Current status: All 23 cases have status "N" - no cases ready for testing
072825 21:44 - QA: Noted SR's priority cases for special testing attention: Case 4 (Survey completion/points), Case 6 (Points redemption), Case 23 (Error handling)
072825 21:44 - QA: Ready to test cases when status changes to "T" - will monitor cases.yaml for updates
072825 21:44 - QA: Testing strategy prepared for priority cases:
072825 21:44 - QA:   • Case 4 (Survey completion): Test points awarding, balance updates, activity logging, transaction safety
072825 21:44 - QA:   • Case 6 (Points redemption): Test balance validation, insufficient balance errors, redemption flow
072825 21:44 - QA:   • Case 23 (Error handling): Test validation logic, user-friendly messages, recovery mechanisms
072825 21:44 - QA: Will also test role-based access control, mobile responsiveness, and real-time updates per TDD requirements
