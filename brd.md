## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

- **Minimal Design:** Clean, uncluttered interface with focus on functionality
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- **Card-Based Layout:** Survey and redemption options displayed as cards
- **Prominent Points Display:** Current point balance clearly visible throughout the app
- **Activity Feed:** Chronological list of user activities and transactions
- **Graceful Empty States:** All list views (e.g., surveys, offers, activity logs) must display a friendly message when no data is available, rather than an error. This ensures a positive user experience even when the database is empty.

  - The left navigation (sidebar) is visible for all logged-in users (panelists and admins).
  - The sidebar is collapsible: it can be expanded or collapsed by the user.

    - Panelists
    - Surveys
    - Live Surveys
